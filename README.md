## To Start

**Note** - One of the dependencies is Xcode. While installing, if you run into an error that says, `gyp: No Xcode or CLT version detected!` please do the following:
1. Execute `xcode-select --install` in terminal.
2. Delete the "node_modules" folder located within the "catch-of-the-day" folder.
3. Execute `npm install` once more.

`cd` into `catch-of-the-day` and follow along with the videos

Each numbered folder in `stepped-solutions` contains the files for the beginning of each correspondingly numbered video, should you need them. So, if you need any code, pull the appropriate file into your `catch-of-the-day` folder.

You are welcome to submit Pull Requests but I'd like to keep the code as similar as possible to the course content.

### Code Use

You are welcome to use this code in your own applications. If you would like to use it for training purposes, please shoot me a message first to make sure it's okay.

## htaccess

Here is the .htaccess file we use in the apache deployment video

```
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```
